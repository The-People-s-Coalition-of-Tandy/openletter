  Dear all , Here is a call of more than 90 Israeli musicians re the situation
  in Israel and Palestine. If you would like to be added (Israeli musician
  living in Israel or abroad, as we know that for Arab or Arab Isralei or
  Palestinian musicians this would be difficult - but we would be happy to add
  you if you wish) please leave your name, place, and what you do in the
  comments and i can add you.


  Also see the first comment for organziations to follow or donate to. These organizations have been consistently working over years towards peace.


  We will be grateful for sharing over social media widely .

  We are a group of Israeli composers and musicians, living both in Israel and abroad. We call for an immediate end to all Israeli violence in Gaza and the West Bank and for a dedicated, determined effort to restore what has been destroyed. The notion that violence and destruction will bring security has failed us for 75 years. Violence only breeds more violence.


  We are horrified by the killing and maiming of so many uninvolved and so many children, who bear no blame and whose suffering should shake us all to our core. No security justification can excuse the loss of innocent lives. We must not lose our humanity or our capacity for empathy.


  We also call for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages and all unjustified administrative detentions. The suffering of the kidnapped and detained and their families must not be ignoredâ€”human life and dignity must be upheld above all.


  Not all Palestinians are our enemies, just as not all Israelis support violence. We refuse to fall into hatred and dehumanization. We urge a complete and permanent end to killing and destruction and a resolute commitment to building a future founded on justice, peace, and true neighborly relations.


  We write these words because we cannot remain silent in the face of such suffering and destruction. As artists, as human beings, and as people who are able to envision an alternative route, we feel an internal, moral obligation to speak out. We insist that another path is possible. By voicing this position, we hope to contribute to the growing chorus of those demanding a change in approach, a change in direction, toward a future of coexistence.
